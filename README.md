My first project.

A 1U 18hp eurorack module for interfacing over I2C with Bela Pepper. It contains a 0.91" SSD1306 OLED, two rotary encoders, and is run by an arduino nano every.

240428 status: communication between arduino, rotary encoder and oled is established. Circuit board designed. Next step is to establish I2C with the Bela.
